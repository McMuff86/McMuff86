Here's the refined version of your GitHub `README.md`:  

### Welcome to My Digital Workshop – MechX  

I specialize in CAD/CAM, digital manufacturing, and automation, with a strong focus on CNC machining, 3D printing, and parametric design. My expertise lies in developing custom scripts for Rhino & Grasshopper, optimizing production workflows, and integrating AI into manufacturing and design processes.  

Beyond engineering, I explore AI-driven art, pushing the boundaries of generative design and digital aesthetics. My work also extends to woodworking and architecture, blending traditional craftsmanship with computational techniques to create innovative and functional designs.  

Currently working on **custom Rhino plugins, CNC process optimization, parametric BIM workflows, and AI-generated design solutions.**  

Let's push the limits of digital fabrication and intelligent design.
