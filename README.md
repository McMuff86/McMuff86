# Where Craftsmanship Meets Code ⚡

**Project Manager & Software Developer** bridging traditional craftsmanship with digital manufacturing and AI.

I come from the workshop floor — trained as a carpenter, worked the CNC machines, went through technical school (Dipl. Techniker HF Innenausbau), and now I build the software tools I always wished existed in the industry.

### 🔧 What I Do

I work at the intersection of **construction, CAD/CAM, and software development**. By day, I manage door and frame installation projects at a Swiss carpentry company. By night, I write code that automates the painful manual workflows I see every day.

**Core expertise:**
- 🏗️ Construction project management (doors, frames, interior build-out)
- 🦏 Rhino / Grasshopper scripting & plugin development (Python, C#)
- ⚙️ CNC process optimization & CAD-to-production pipelines
- 🤖 AI agent systems & workflow automation
- 📐 Parametric design & BIM workflows

### 🚀 What I'm Building

**IntelliPlan** — A SaaS platform for project management automation in the carpentry and construction industry. Turning messy Excel sheets and scattered emails into structured, automated workflows.

**OpenClaw** — My personal AI assistant system with autonomous agents, Gmail integration, and proactive task management.

**Rhino/Grasshopper Tools** — Custom plugins and scripts for digital fabrication, including CAM interfaces and automated part extraction.

### 💡 Philosophy

I believe the best software comes from people who've done the actual work. I've stood at the CNC machine, managed the chaotic construction site, and now I write the code to make it all smoother. Every tool I build solves a problem I've lived through.
